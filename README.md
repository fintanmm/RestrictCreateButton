# Disable the create site for everyone bar Alfresco Admin user

Currently it only checks to see if the user is admin.

The plan is to have a group that can be changed by editing siteCreateGroup.

Auto deploy is set to true.

Create a jar file
```
jar cf ../RestrictCreateButton.jar
```

Then deploy the file to shared/lib or to webapps/share/WEB-INF/lib folder. Restart tomcat.
